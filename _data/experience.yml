intro:
  After graduating from NITK I worked at Adobe for the next three years. 
  I started in a team that worked on a research-y customer-facing 
  application that involved a lot of prototyping and back-and-forth with 
  the customers. After that project was handed over to a passive maintenance 
  team, I built prototypes for components of Adobe's Sensei. I left
  Adobe to join MScAC that I am pursing currently at University of Toronto.

    intro: 
      This project aimed at taking machine learning algorithms developed in expert silos inside Adobe and 
      helping other teams that need the intelligence use them. Back in 2015 when every major organization
      was working on setting up a machine learning pipeline, I worked on a prototype that platform-agnostic,
      easily extendable and user-friendly for machine learning consumers. 

      - Worked on deploying machine learning algorithms as services for teams inside Adobe.
      - Worked with data scientists to understand working of algorithms and the feature transformations for data.
      - Adapted learning and testing algorithms to generalize settings and parameters, to make it usable for other teams.
      - Created representations of feature transforms and built an ETL framework to consume data from users.
      - Designed and built a multi-cloud (AWS, Azure, in-house) service management framework on Azure and AWS.
      - Built data pipelines, configuration services and scheduling interfaces for setting up model training.

    intro:
      As a fresh grad at Adobe, I was involved in helping take an analytical [marketing mix model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix_modeling) 
      solver to production. I took the prototype, rewrote it using Pandas (yes, it was earlier using dicts and lists)
      and then improved and tested the SQL queries. Eventually, the product was taken to production. Then, I 
      handed over the project to long term maintenance teams and moved on to shipping ML as a service.
      
      - Optimized customer spends using a customized analytical marketing mix model solver.
      - Built massive ETL pipelines, provided seasonality and multiple campaign support to customers.
      - Gained experience of working in a highly agile, self-motivated research project.
