intro:
  After graduating from NITK I worked at Adobe for the next three years. 
  I started in a team that worked on a research-y customer-facing 
  application that involved a lot of prototyping and back-and-forth with 
  the customers. After that project was handed over to a passive maintenance 
  team, I built prototypes for components of Adobe's Sensei. I left
  Adobe to join MScAC that I am pursing currently at University of Toronto.
