    intro:
      We build a machine learning model to classify mobile phone accelerometer
      data into  terrain  information. GPS  information  is  used  to correlate
      multiple accelerometer readings, enabling crowdsourcing.  Road segments are
      eventually assigned a binary label, with a confidence that increases with the
      amount of data at hand. The system is verified with walks around Toronto.

    intro:
      This project tries to characterize applications that run on a heterogenous, 
      multi-tier cloud.  A metric is created based on the performance of the app 
      in relation to the resources it's assigned, that can be used to make future 
      decisions about the application. This measure also lets us make decisions
      about reprovisioning applications while having least impact on
      performance guarantees. The approach is based on experiments
      run on docker hosts, running on local machines.

  - title: Scale independent raga identification using chromagram patterns and swara based features

    intro:
      In Indian classical music a raga describes the constituent structure
      of notes in a musical piece. In this work, we investigate the problem
      of scale independent automatic raga identification by achieving
      state-of-the-art results using GMM based Hidden Markov Models
      over a collection of features consisting of chromagram patterns,
      mel-cepstrum coefficients and timbre features.On a dataset of 4 ragas -
      darbari, khamaj, malhar and sohini; we have achieved an average accuracy of  97%.

  - title: Call center call analysis for emotion-based cues
    img:

    intro:
      As my undergraduate project, I worked on call center call recordings. Working on a 
      hypothesis that a call center complaint call usually goes from a "conflict" to a "resolution" 
      (or not), I manually labeled several hundred hours of call center calls with binary tags
      and tried to train a HMM model. The takeaways from this project were insight into 
      variabilities in real-world data, how to extract features (MFCC, FFT and other signal features) 
      and working with noisy data. I also learnt a whole lot about how to take an unlabeld dataset
      and go to something that resembeled an annotated dataset. Details of this project remain 
      fairly confidential because of the nature of the dataset we worked on.
