intro:
  We build a machine learning model to classify mobile phone accelerometer
  data into  terrain  information. GPS  information  is  used  to correlate
  multiple accelerometer readings, enabling crowdsourcing.  Road segments are
  eventually assigned a binary label, with a confidence that increases with the
  amount of data at hand. The system is verified with walks around Toronto.
